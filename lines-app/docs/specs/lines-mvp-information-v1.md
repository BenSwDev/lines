2025-12-05 – Lines App – Lines MVP Specification Link

---

The full business and UX specification for the Lines app lives at:

- `information/lines-mvp-information-v1.md`

That file is the **source of truth** for:

- Product overview
- Information architecture and routing
- Domain model (Venue, Line, Occurrence, etc.)
- User flows
- Validation & business rules
- UX and design guidelines

When developing or reviewing features, always read from the original document in `information/` to avoid divergence. This stub exists so AI assistants can discover the spec via the `docs/specs/` folder.
