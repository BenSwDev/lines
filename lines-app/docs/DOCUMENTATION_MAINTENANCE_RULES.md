2025-12-05 – Lines App – Documentation Maintenance Rules (Adapter)

---

This project follows the global rules defined in `information/DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE_RULES.md`.

Key principles (summary):

- If it isn’t written – it didn’t happen.
- Every code / API / DB change must update the relevant docs immediately.
- New tests must be recorded in `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md`.
- Every release must update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`.

This file exists to anchor those rules within the `lines-app` repository. For full details, always read and follow the original document under `information/`.
