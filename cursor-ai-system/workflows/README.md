# Workflows Directory

Document extended workflows here (beyond the daily scan defined in `../setup.md`).
- Use one file per workflow, e.g., `daily-ai-full-scan.md`, `release-hardening.md`.
- Each file should include: purpose, trigger/schedule, inputs, ordered steps, outputs/artifacts, and involved agents.
- Keep `../setup.md` aligned with any new or changed canonical workflows.
