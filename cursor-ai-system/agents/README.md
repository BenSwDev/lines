# Agents Directory

Use this folder for per-agent deep specifications, examples, and prompts.
- Create one file per agent, e.g., `01-code-correctness.md`, matching the agent list in `../setup.md`.
- Keep naming and numbering consistent with the master list to avoid ambiguity when reloading in Cursor.
- Update `../setup.md` if any canonical change is made to the agent roster or responsibilities.
