# Rules Directory

Store strong/global rules and guardrails for Cursor here.
- Examples: security rules, refactor guardrails, documentation rules.
- Keep rule names clear (e.g., `strong-rules.md`, `documentation-rules.md`).
- If rule changes affect the master behavior, reflect the update in `../setup.md`.
